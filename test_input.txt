Dr. Smith visited the U.S.A. last summer. He met with Prof. Johnson, Ph.D., at the University of California, Berkeley. They discussed various topics including A.I. and machine learning. The weather was beautiful that day, reaching 75Â°F! Mrs. Anderson, their research assistant, took detailed notes during the meeting. Later, they went to St. Mary's Hospital for a conference on medical technology. "This is groundbreaking research," said Dr. Smith. The team plans to publish their findings in the journal Nature next month.
